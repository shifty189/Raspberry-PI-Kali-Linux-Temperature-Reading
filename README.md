 Raspberry-PI-Kali-Linux-Temperature-Reading
I created this Python Script becouse i couldn't find any tool to monitor the CPU temperature on my Rasberry Pi running Kali Linux
This script also works on Lakka for Raspberry Pi. I suspect that this will work on all images made specificly for RP.

-h  Display Help options (there aren't many)

-c  Display temperature in only celsius

-f  Display temperature in only fahrenheit

-k  Continuously display the temperature every second and keep track of max and min temperature

-s  Determine in seconds how often to check temperature. Default is one a second
